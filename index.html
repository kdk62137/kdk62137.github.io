Twenty-eight years later, he cemented his place in history when he broke the color barrier and became the first African American to compete in Major League Baseball in the modern era. Robinson would go on to win the MLB’s 1947 Rookie of the Year award before embarking on an illustrious career as a ball player, television analyst, businessman and civil rights leader.
